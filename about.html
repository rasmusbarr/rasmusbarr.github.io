This is Rasmus Barringer's personal website; new and sparsely populated as of 2016.
Information here is presented in the hope that it will be useful and/or interesting.
This includes tricks or algorithms I (Rasmus) come up with and possibly some information about projects I'm working on or have finished.
Algorithms presented are likely original (to the extent of my knowledge), unless otherwise is stated, and I put no restriction on their use by anyone (no warranty of course).
Any supplied source code will have license information provided (likely the MIT license).
		</p><p>
I know a bit about physics (MSc) and a bit more about graphics (PhD).
I was until recently at Lund University in Sweden but are currently bootstrapping myself into game development.
I also work on industrial surveillance systems.
For my university work, visit <a href="http://cs.lth.se/rasmus_barringer">http://cs.lth.se/rasmus_barringer</a>.
Please do not contact me on the university email since I rarely check it and probably can't at some point in the future.
Use Twitter (@rasmusbarr) or gmail (rasmus.barringer).
